# ðŸ“¡ Responses

Depending on how you sent your request (synchronous/asynchronous) you will either receive an instance of `Response` or a `PromiseInterface.`

### Handling synchronous responses

By default, Saloon will return an instance of `Saloon\Http\Response`. This response class contains many helpful methods for interacting with your HTTP response. You can see a list of the available methods below.

```php
<?php

$forge = new ForgeConnector('api-token');
$response = $forge->send(new GetServersRequest);

$body = $response->body();
$decodedBody = $response->json();
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
By default, Saloon will not throw an exception if a synchronous request fails. [Refer to the handling failures section for handling errors.](handling-failures.md)
{% endhint %}

### Handling asynchronous responses

When using concurrent requests/pooling or `sendAsync` , Saloon will respond with a `GuzzleHttp\Promise\PromiseInterface.` The promise will contain a `Response` a class described above. When the request fails, Saloon will not use the `then` method but return an instance of `RequestException`in the `otherwise` block.

```php
<?php

use Saloon\Http\Response;

$forge = new ForgeConnector('api-token');
$promise = $forge->sendAsync(new GetServersRequest);

$promise
    ->then(function (Response $response) {
        // Handle successful response
    })
    ->otherwise(function (Exception $exception) {
        // Handle failed request
    });
```

### Custom responses

Sometimes you may want to use your response class. This is useful if you want to add your methods or overwrite Saloon's response methods. Saloon allows you to overwrite the response at a connector level for all requests or at a per-request level for a granular response.

You may extend the `Saloon\Http\Response` class or provide your own implementation with the `Saloon\Http\Response` interface. You may use the `HasResponseHelpers` middleware when making your own implementation to save defining every method.

#### Using the response property

The simplest way of registering a custom response is to use the `$response` property on either the connector or request.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Connector" %}
<pre class="language-php"><code class="lang-php">&#x3C;?php

use Saloon\Http\Connector;

class ForgeConnector extends Connector
{
    // {...}
    
<strong>    protected ?string $response = CustomResponse::class;
</strong>}
</code></pre>
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Request" %}
<pre class="language-php"><code class="lang-php">&#x3C;?php

use Saloon\Http\Request;

class GetServersRequest extends Request
{
    // {...}
    
<strong>    protected ?string $response = CustomResponse::class;
</strong>}
</code></pre>
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

#### Using the resolveResponseClass method

When you need a more advanced way to define a custom response, use the `resolveResponseClass` method on either the connector or request.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Connector" %}
```php
<?php

use Saloon\Http\Connector;

class ForgeConnector extends Connector
{
    // {...}
    
    public function resolveResponseClass(): string
    {
        return CustomResponse::class;
    }
}
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Request" %}
```php
<?php

use Saloon\Http\Request;

class GetServersRequest extends Request
{
    // {...}
    
    public function resolveResponseClass(): string
    {
        return CustomResponse::class;
    }
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
