# ü™ù Building SDKs

Saloon provides everything you need to build a great SDK or library for an API. It already offers the ability to mock responses, provide authentication, implement OAuth2 boilerplate and even record your API requests in your tests. With Saloon you won't need to write the same boilerplate code over and over again. Saloon comes with just three dependencies making your library or SDK lightweight.

### Getting Started

{% hint style="info" %}
This guide assumes you know the basics of connectors, requests and sending requests.
{% endhint %}

This guide will be using Pok√©API as an example API. [Click here to see a full SDK example repository](https://github.com/Sammyjo20/pokeapi-sdk/tree/v3).

To start building an SDK with Saloon, we recommend that you create a connector as your SDK class. This class allows you to configure the base URL and any defaults you may need like default headers or authentication.

This is an example SDK for the [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/). As you can see, I have defined the API base URL, as well as used the constructor to provide an authentication token. I have also defined some default headers.

```php
<?php

namespace Pokeapi;

use Saloon\Http\Connector;
use Saloon\Http\Request;

class Pokeapi extends Connector
{
    public function __construct(string $token)
    {
        $this->withTokenAuth($token);
    }

    public function resolveBaseUrl(): string
    {
        return 'https://pokeapi.co/api/v2';
    }

    protected function defaultHeaders(): array
    {
        return [
            'Accept' => 'application/json',
            'Content-Type' => 'application/json',
        ];
    }
}
```

Now that we have created the SDK class, all we need to do is instantiate it and provide the API token. We are now ready to send requests through our SDK. You may add your methods to this class as it is the root class of your SDK.

```php
<?php

use Pokeapi\Pokeapi;

$pokeapi = new Pokeapi('my-api-token');

// Ready to make requests!
```

### Sending Requests

One of the ways that you can build SDKs in Saloon is by creating request classes and then calling them from the SDK connector. This is the simplest way and you will get up and running really quickly with Saloon. Make sure you are familiar with how requests work first.

#### Getting started

Firstly, you will need to [create a request](requests.md), this is the same as making a normal request described in the documentation.

#### Use your request

When you have created the request, all that developers would need to do is instantiate and send the request on the connector. This means you only need to have two classes as a minimum for a fully working SDK!

```php
<?php

use Pokeapi\Pokeapi;

$pokeapi = new Pokeapi('my-api-token');
$request = new GetAllPokemon(page: 1);

// Developers would just send the request.

$response = $pokeapi->send($request);
```

With this method, it‚Äôs really simple to build your SDK. All you would need to do is create all the requests and then document them in your README. Developers using your SDK can just instantiate your SDK and then use the `send` methods. This also gives the developer freedom to customise the request's headers, config and query parameters if they choose to.

### Sending Requests With Methods

Sometimes you may want to make it easy for the developer to find all the methods that they need to call the API through your SDK. You can create methods on your connector which send an API request or you could write a "resource" class that contains lots of requests

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Definition" %}
```php
class Pokeapi extends Connector
{
    // ...
    
    public function allPokemon(int $page): Response
    {
        return $this->send(new GetAllPokemon($page));
    }
}
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Usage" %}
```php
<?php

$pokeapi = new Pokeapi('my-api-token');

$response = $pokeapi->allPokemon(page: 1);
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Request Resources/Groups

The resource pattern can help you combine your SDK requests into simple groups that are easy for the developer to find and consume. First, we'll create a class that extends Saloon's `BaseResource` class.

For this API, I will create a Pok√©mon resource which will group all the Pok√©mon requests together. Imagine a resource like a controller in an MVC framework like Laravel. You should pass any arguments the request needs through the method arguments.

<pre class="language-php"><code class="lang-php">&#x3C;?php

use Saloon\Http\BaseResource;
use Saloon\Http\Response;

<strong>class PokemonResource extends BaseResource
</strong>{
     public function all(int $page): Response
     {
         return $this->connector->send(new GetAllPokemon($page));
     }
     
     public function get(int $id): Response
     {
         return $this->connector->send(new GetSinglePokemon($id));
     }
}
</code></pre>

#### Defining a resource on your connector

Now we'll define a method on the connector which returns this resource class. Don't forget to pass the connector's instance (`$this`) into the resource.

```php
class Pokeapi extends Connector
{
    // ...
    
    public function pokemon(): PokemonResource
    {
        return new PokemonResource($this);
    }
}
```

Now all our users have to do is access the `pokemon()` method on the SDK class to get access to all the various requests that our SDK has to offer.

```php
<?php

$pokeapi = new Pokeapi('my-api-token');

$allPokemon = $pokeapi->pokemon()->all(page: 1);

$giratina = $pokeapi->pokemon()->get(id: 'giratina');
```

### Custom Responses

You may wish to customise the `Response` class that is returned by Saloon from your SDK connector. [Click here to read more about custom responses.](building-sdks.md#custom-responses)

### Additional Features

Please read through the other sections of Saloon's documentation to see the other features that you can offer for your SDK. Every other feature like testing, authentication, failure handling is all supported for SDKs.

### Testing

When building an SDK, it's important to write tests that ensure the SDK calls the correct requests from an API and returns the right response, especially if you're converting the response into a data-transfer-object. [Read through the testing section of the documentation](testing/manual-fake-responses.md) to get familiar with mocking and recording requests.
