# ðŸ“¸ Recording Responses

When writing tests for an API integration, it is best to simulate a real request as much as possible. With Saloon's MockResponse class, you can build up example responses manually. This is useful, but it can be time-consuming, especially if an API returns a huge amount of data, it would take a long time to manually write MockResponses and keep it maintained.

Saloon has a feature called fixture recording, this feature will allow you to make a real request to the API you are integrating with and then it will store that response in a file for later. This is a common practice for people writing integrations for APIs, but Saloon makes it effortless.&#x20;

### Registering a MockClient

Request recording starts with a `MockClient`. This class can be applied directly to a connector instance to be used across all requests, or it can be applied on a per-request basis.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="All Requests (Connector)" %}
```php
<?php

use Saloon\Http\Faking\MockClient;
use Saloon\Http\Faking\MockResponse;

$mockClient = new MockClient([
    MockResponse::fixture('servers.index'),
]);

$forge = new ForgeConnector;
$forge->withMockClient($mockClient);
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Individual Request" %}
```php
<?php

use Saloon\Http\Faking\MockClient;
use Saloon\Http\Faking\MockResponse;

$mockClient = new MockClient([
    MockResponse::fixture('servers.index'),
]);

$forge = new ForgeConnector;
$request = new GetAllServersRequest;

// Send a request with a MockClient

$forge->send($request, $mockClient);
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Using Laravel?

If you are using Laravel, as well as the Saloon Laravel helper library, you don't have to use `withMockClient` on every instance of your connector. You may use the `Saloon` facade `fake` method to define your mock responses. This is a built-in global MockClient that when used will be applied to _all_ Saloon requests sent in your application.

```php
<?php

use Saloon\Laravel\Facades\Saloon;

Saloon::fake([
    MockResponse::fixture('servers.index'),
]);
```

### Setup

Getting started with fixture recording is easy. When defining your mock responses, instead of defining a MockResponse with headers, data and config - use the fixture static property. This property will accept a single argument, the fixture name.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Non-Laravel" %}
```php
<?php

$mockClient = new MockClient([
    GetForgeServerRequest::class => MockResponse::fixture('singleServer')
]);
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Laravel" %}
```php
<?php

Saloon::fake([
    GetForgeServerRequest::class => MockResponse::fixture('singleServer')
]);
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The above example will configure a fixture to be used every time the **UserRequest** is called during mocking. You may also use a sequence of fixtures, connector mocking, or use a fixture on a specific URL path. Read the mocking pages for more information.
{% endhint %}

### How does it work?

Once you have defined a fixture to be used for a particular request pattern, you can make a request just like you normally would. Saloon will check if the fixture already exists, and if it doesn't - it will make the real API request and store the response for next time.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Non-Laravel" %}
```php
<?php

$mockClient = new MockClient([
    GetForgeServerRequest::class => MockResponse::fixture('singleServer')
]);

$forge = new ForgeConnector;
$forge->withMockClient($mockClient);

// The initial request will check if a fixture called "singleServer" 
// exists. Because it doesn't exist yet, the real request will be
// sent and the response will be recorded.

$request = new GetForgeServerRequest(12345);
$response = $forge->send($request);

// However, the next time the request is made, the fixture will 
// exist, and Saloon will not make the request again.

$request = new GetForgeServerRequest(12345);
$response = $forge->send($request);
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Laravel" %}
```php
<?php

Saloon::fake([
    GetForgeServerRequest::class => MockResponse::fixture('singleServer')
]);

$forge = new ForgeConnector;

// The initial request will check if a fixture called "singleServer" 
// exists. Because it doesn't exist yet, the real request will be
// sent and the response will be recorded.

$request = new GetForgeServerRequest(12345);
$response = $forge->send($request);

// However, the next time the request is made, the fixture will 
// exist, and Saloon will not make the request again.

$request = new GetForgeServerRequest(12345);
$response = $forge->send($request);
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Namespacing

Depending on the size of your application and the number of API integrations you have, you may want to namespace the fixtures into their own folders, for example, I may have a "forge" namespace and a "digitalOcean" namespace.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Non-Laravel" %}
```php
<?php

$mockClient = new MockClient([
    GetForgeServerRequest::class => MockResponse::fixture('forge/singleServer'),
    GetDigitalOceanServerRequest::class => MockResponse::fixture('digitalOcean/singleServer'),
]);
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Laravel" %}
```php
<?php

Saloon::fake([
    GetForgeServerRequest::class => MockResponse::fixture('forge/singleServer'),
    GetDigitalOceanServerRequest::class => MockResponse::fixture('digitalOcean/singleServer'),
]);
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Configuration

#### Fixture Path

Ordinarily, Saloon will store all fixtures in a **tests/Fixtures/Saloon** directory. If you would like to customise this, you may use the MockConfig class in your tests or in your setUp methods.

```php
<?php

MockConfig::setFixturePath('tests/other-directory')
```

#### Preventing Unwanted Requests

Once you have written all of your tests, you might want to prevent accidental API requests in the future for fixtures that don't exist. If you would like Saloon to throw exceptions if a fixture does not exist, you may do this with the MockConfig class.

```php
<?php

MockConfig::throwOnMissingFixtures()
```

### Advanced Usage

You may want to return custom fixtures based on the request without specifying exact names of fixtures. For example, I might want to build a fixture name based on the name of the request being sent. You may use a closure inside the mock client and write the custom logic to meet these needs.&#x20;

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Non-Laravel" %}
```php
<?php

$mockClient = new MockClient([
    '*' => function (PendingRequest $request) {
        $reflection = new ReflectionClass($request->getRequest());

        return MockResponse::fixture($reflection->getShortName());
    },
]);

$forge = new ForgeConnector;
$forge->withMockClient($mockClient);

// This will create a fixture called "GetForgeServerRequest"

$request = new GetForgeServerRequest(12345);
$response = $forge->send($request);

// This will create a fixture called "GetAllForgeServersRequest"

$request = new GetAllForgeServersRequest($data);
$response = $forge->send($request);
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Laravel" %}
```php
<?php

Saloon::fake([
    '*' => function (PendingRequest $request) {
        $reflection = new ReflectionClass($request->getRequest());

        return MockResponse::fixture($reflection->getShortName());
    },
]);

$forge = new ForgeConnector;

// This will create a fixture called "GetForgeServerRequest"

$request = new GetForgeServerRequest(12345);
$response = $forge->send($request);

// This will create a fixture called "GetAllForgeServersRequest"

$request = new GetAllForgeServersRequest($data);
$response = $forge->send($request);
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Another example from [Astrotomic's Steam SDK](https://github.com/Astrotomic/steam-sdk) allows you to create a directory for each request. This is really useful for organising your mock fixtures.

```php
<?php

$mockClient = new MockClient([
    '*' => function (PendingRequest $pendingRequest) {
        $name = implode('/', array_filter([
             parse_url($pendingRequest->getUrl(), PHP_URL_HOST),
             mb_strtoupper($pendingRequest->getMethod() ?? 'GET'),
             parse_url($pendingRequest->getUrl(), PHP_URL_PATH),
             http_build_query(array_diff_key($pendingRequest->query()->all(), array_flip(['key', 'format']))),
        ]));
          
        return MockResponse::fixture($name);
    },
]);
```
