# ðŸ¤— Credits

### Special Thanks

* [Juse Less](https://github.com/juse-less) for contributing to many core features of Saloon v2 but mainly pagination and debugging.
* [Tom Witkowski](https://github.com/Gummibeer) for contributing to Saloon's fixture recording and helping decide many core parts of version two like data transfer objects and the error handler.
* [Caneco](https://github.com/caneco) for such a wonderful logo and branding.
* [Ashley Allen](https://github.com/ash-jc-allen) for working closely with me and writing an amazing book that features Saloon ([Consuming APIs in Laravel](https://consuming-apis-in-laravel.com/)). Ashley made countless contributions to the documentation and helped make decisions for v3.

### But also... Thank _you_.

This is my chance to thank you - the amazing PHP community for installing, using and contributing to Saloon's success. I absolutely love working on open source and working within the PHP community as it feels so rewarding. It's an absolute honour to build something that people enjoy and actively use. I hope it will be useful for many years ahead.
